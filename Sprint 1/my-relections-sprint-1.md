**Thinking like a Programmer?**
My understanding before reading and searching. Is that if you where to think like a programmer you would be very good at seeing potential impacts. This has this flow on effect, and the same frame of mind very good at trouble shooting and problem solving. Also thinking like a programmer to me is not having all the answers rather knowing there is an answer but I need to find and have the necassary skills to start it and find the rest out. 

Looking around the net, I wouldn't say what I thought was wrong but it is missing a big part of the picture. Programmers are never on the own, they will have people they work with or friend/associates they can talk to and ask. There is a big community out there and more than likely someone out there has had the same or at least very similar issue that they can help with.
They don't give up, they will stick with a problem to find the soloution. With this as well they challange themselves they take on things that they may not fully understand but have the confidence in themselves that they can solve it. When they do this they take a big problem and shrink it down. They now the desired end result and the starting point and split the process into managable steps.

Communication as well. Programmers understand the need to be able to explain to machines and people what they are doing. (I hear, not the ones I have worked with). For the programmers I've worked with I struggle with what there are telling me and in turn they produce something that does not meet the requirements. Communication is both ways and the need to understand what a potential client wants is important. 

Always learning. Things in the industry are never stationery and are always evloving from new languages to new best practices. When programmers learn they don't try to memorize, if it happens it happens but its not the expected outcome. Instead they practice, the build projects and features to learn how something works. They also embrace the unkown, they are self aware of what they may not know. Whilst they may want to know it, if there is more skilled users in that area they will step down.

They are never done with something or at least there is always improvments. Writting a peice of code can always be improved on, this is Refactoring. This is when something is solved but the programmer looks over to se if there is a better soloution and that the code excuted is clear and concise.




**What does the interet say about flipped learning? What is flipped learning?**
Flipped learning is all about giving the power to the student. Power to learn in any way they want. The program/instuition provides all the materials required to learn. It's then up to the student on how they digest this information. This lets students learn in ways they feel are productive for themselves. Personoally myself I like learning the Tech parts of the course early on the morning, this is where I'm focused and haven't had any distractions from the outside world. Later on in the afternoon is where I start looking at core (not saying core is not important) but during this time my ability to focus and block distractions is limited. By this time I would have chatted a few people or gone through my socials. 

This way of learning is good for letting students learn at there own pace. If they undestand something easily they can go ahead and the otherway if students are stuggling with a topic they can go over the lesson again and at any time. This is great because there is this socail stigma of being ahead or being behind and learning this way helps emliminate this factor.



**What is a flipped classroom?**
A flipped classroom is where convential learning no longer takes place. The sort of 'Convential' learning is done by the student in a flipped learning environment where they learn how they want to. The teachers provide the material for that. The flipped classroom is where students and teachers come together to put what they learned into practice. The idea here being that class time is freed up for collobartive work, projects, questions and teacher assited learning. 

Flipped learning/Classrooms foster the idea that everyone [teachers as well] from each other. Another benefit is that students are encouraged to figure things out themselves. Not everything will be spoon feed to a student. Personally I remember watching a seperate video on CMD, I tried what he tried didn't work so I paused it. Read up on it myself and solved my issue. When I resumed the vide he than says ohh I made an error here that's why it did not work. Personally I felt more engaged and learned more when I solved the problem.




**How do you think it will relate to your learning journey?**
For me I learn by doing. I will study and read something, but in order for me to feel like I know it I need to put it into practice. For ages I tried to learn Python to automate my old job, I struggled for ages. Until I finally gave up on that style of learning. I could not remember everything. So I decided to make projects and that's what I would learn. This week I will code this project, (create an assignment tool in python that talks with SQL that exports XML to upload). Anything I did not know I consaluted my mate at work or used google. This was the best approach for me, I feel like the other way fosters an environment of trying to learn everything and when you don't it feels like faliure.
